# Fully programmable eBay Amazon sales platform.
The Network Sales Monitor is a fully customizable and scalable selling platform for high volume online sales. It can connect to multiple instances of online sales channels, allowing for unlimited selling capabilities. 

The purpose of the platform is to automate the import of standard product sales channels into a unified environment where they can then be passed on to the next phase of the selling process. 

In traditional online sales systems, the second stage of the selling process is controlled by the shipping system. If you want to integrate your own warehouse system, or selling procedure, it's not possible. They control where your sales arrive and what you can do with them. This works for most sellers because their normal selling procedure is standard. 

But if you need something specific, you would be forced to build a custom platform. The intention of this application is to give those users a starting point where they can build from.

# Use cases
You are a normal Fulfilled by Amazon user. You send your products to Amazon and they ship them for you. You do some research and SEO to improve the sales of your products. YOU DON'T NEED THIS SYSTEM, YOU HAVE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE*
