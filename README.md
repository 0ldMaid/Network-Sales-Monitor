# Fully programmable eBay Amazon sales platform
The Network Sales Monitor is a fully customizable and scalable selling platform for high volume online sales. It can connect to multiple instances of online sales channels, allowing for unlimited selling capabilities. 

The purpose of the platform is to automate the import of standard product sales channels into a unified environment where they can then be passed on to the next phase of the selling process. 

In traditional online sales systems, the second stage of the selling process is controlled by the shipping system. If you want to integrate your own warehouse system, or selling procedure, it's not possible. They control where your sales arrive and what you can do with them. This works for most sellers because their normal selling procedure is standard. 

But if you need something specific, you would be forced to build a custom platform. The intention of this application is to give those users a starting point where they can build from.

# Use cases
You are a normal Fulfilled by Amazon user. You send your products to Amazon and they ship them for you. You do some research and SEO to improve the sales of your products. YOU DON'T NEED THIS SYSTEM, YOU HAVE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE*

You have a company with reasonable resources and IT skills. You have a product that has high sales volume and you are currently selling these products using an online sales manager. You have come up with a plan to automate your selling procedure and reduce costs. But unfortunately the selling platform you are using doesn't have any upgradability or customization. THIS SYSTEM WAS MADE FOR YOU*

# Application
The application is 100% Java and currently has the ability to connect to Amazon, eBay, Magento, Etsy, and PayPal. The application can export sales data to CSV and quickbooks. And build shipping labels using Dazzle. 

# Installation
For testing purposes you can use the Windows .exe installation file to install everything automatically. Or you can download the .zip archive from this repository and run the application yourself. Make sure you incude the EXT folder in your JRE or the application won't run.
