# Fully programmable eBay Amazon sales platform.
The Network Sales Monitor is a fully customizable and scalable selling platform for high volume online sales. It can connect to multiple instances of online sales channels allowing for unlimited selling capabilities. 

The purpose of the platform is to automate the import of standard product sales channels into a unified environment where they can then be passed on to the next phase of the selling process. 

In traditional online sales systems, the second stage of the selling process is controlled by the shipping system. If you want to integrate your own warehouse system, or selling procedure, it's not possible. They control where your sales arrive and what you can do with them. This works for most sellers because their normal selling procedure is standard.
